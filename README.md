# SLINGSHOT SIMULATOR

This is a simple Python application using the Pygame library to demonstrate the gravitational slingshot effect. In this simulation, a spacecraft is launched from a user-defined location towards a planet, experiencing gravitational attraction and potentially achieving a slingshot effect around the planet.

## Features
- Allows users to define the initial position of the spacecraft and the target destination by clicking on the screen.
- Simulates gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the planet.
- Implements the slingshot effect when the spacecraft gets close to the planet.
- Removes spacecraft from the simulation when it goes off-screen or collides with the planet.
- Provides a visually interactive environment using Pygame graphics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Slingshot-Simulator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Slingshot-Simulator
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the simulation:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
5. Click on the screen to define the starting position of the spacecraft and the target destination. Release the mouse button to launch the spacecraft towards the target.
6. Watch as the spacecraft is affected by gravitational attraction and potentially achieves a slingshot effect around the planet.
7. Close the simulation window to exit.

## Controls
- Left-click: Set the starting position of the spacecraft or the target destination.
- Close window button: Quit the simulation.

## Acknowledgments
- This project is inspired by the concepts of orbital mechanics and gravitational slingshot effects.
- Built with the Pygame library, making it easy to create interactive simulations with Python.
