SLING-SHOT SIMULATOR 

This is a simple Python application using the Pygame library to demonstrate the gravitational slingshot effect. In this simulation, a spacecraft is launched from a user-defined location towards a planet, experiencing gravitational attraction and potentially achieving a slingshot effect around the planet.

Features
Allows users to define the initial position of the spacecraft and the target destination by clicking on the screen.
Simulates gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the planet.
Implements the slingshot effect when the spacecraft gets close to the planet.
Removes spacecraft from the simulation when it goes off-screen or collides with the planet.
Provides a visually interactive environment using Pygame graphics.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library
Installation and Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gravitational-slingshot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd gravitational-slingshot
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the simulation:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Click on the screen to define the starting position of the spacecraft and the target destination. Release the mouse button to launch the spacecraft towards the target.

Watch as the spacecraft is affected by gravitational attraction and potentially achieves a slingshot effect around the planet.

Close the simulation window to exit.

Controls
Left-click: Set the starting position of the spacecraft or the target destination.
Close window button: Quit the simulation.
